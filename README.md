# Temperature_Montoring_Web_Server

This is a solution using the Arduino IDE for the DS18B20 temperature sensor with ESP8266. The required libraries have been installed and the code has been written to receive readings from one or more sensors. A simple web server was also created to display the sensorÂ readings.
